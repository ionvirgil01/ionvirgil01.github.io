I’m a statistician and data scientist driven by the challenge of transforming data into clear, actionable insights. My work bridges statistics with creative problem solving using statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization to support decision-making and innovation.

With a background in applied statistics and programming, I specialize in designing clean, efficient data pipelines and building models that tell a story, not just return a number. Whether analyzing large-scale datasets, automating workflows, or communicating findings through data, I focus on clarity, transparency, and impact.

I’ve worked on projects ranging from predictive analytics and business intelligence dashboards to experimental research and AI-driven modeling. I’m most energized when turning raw data into strategies that create measurable value, and when collaborating with teams who see data as more than science.
